	<p>You are given a class PiggyBankthat represents an old-school moneybox in the shape of a pig. The
	<br>class has two attributes: dollars and cents, their initial values are passed to the constructor.</p>

	<br>Your goal is to implement an .add_money() method that:

	<br>Accepts two parameters: deposit_dollars and deposit_cents

	<br>Increases the money in the piggy bank by the deposited amount (increases the values of dollars 
	<br>and cents by deposit_dollars and deposit_cents, respectively)

	<br>Ensures that the cents attribute never exceeds 99 (parameters deposit_dollars and deposit_cents 
	<br>of the add_money method can have any value)</p>

	<br><b>Some considerations</b>:

	<br>The PiggyBank constructor initializes dollars and cents with given values

	<br>The .add_money() method should handle any positive deposit amount

	<br>If adding cents results in 100 or more cents, convert the excess to dollars

	<br>For example, starting with PiggyBank(0, 50) (50 cents): adding 50 cents should result in 1 
	<br>dollar and 0 cents (we will have to update the values of both dollars and cents because the 
	<br>attribute cents cannot be equal to 100).

	<br>Note:

	<br>Do not implement input processing

	<br>The class should work with any valid initial values and deposit amounts
